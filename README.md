##               usage:                ##
########################################

* as a script:
run the [main.py](https://github.com/a4arek/Visum_to_BusMezzo_interface/blob/master/main.py) script in Visum (drag & drop).
BusMezzo files (.dat) will be created in the folder with you
* standalone: run main.py from python 


##############################################################
##     Before using the script, please read the following    ##
###     - VISUM INPUT NETWORK (.ver file) REQUIREMENTS:       ##
###     (otherwise the BM export will NOT work properly!)     ##
##############################################################

### LINKS:
- Bidirectional LINKS can be used in Visum for intermediate LINEROUTE segments.
- !! BUT !! - First and last STOPPOINTS (LINEROUTE segments) should always be placed on separate, unidirectional LINKS!
- (This is to comply with the Mezzo representation of in/out {links} as an exit from / entry to the PuT depot.)

### LINKTYPES:
- Visum LINKTYPE data -> mapped into the BM {sdfuncs} data.
- BM {sdfunc} max. speed assumed from the v0_PrT_max parameter in Visum.

### ZONES / CONNECTORS:
- ZONES will be imported as additional {stops} into BusMezzo.
- CONNECTORS should be pinned directly to ACCESSNODES - these will be imported as additional {stop_distances}.

### STOPS / STOPAREAS / STOPPOINTS:
- BusMezzo {stops} will be imported from the STOPAREA level - therefore, each STOPPOINT should be preferably assigned
  to an individual STOPAREA (actually - that's highly recommended, otherwise BusMezzo network might not work properly).
- STOPPOINTS in Visum should be defined as directed, on LINKS.
- Important!! Separate STOPPOINTS/STOPAREAS are always required for PuT LINEROUTES which either:
  commence from / pass through / or terminate at that particular STOP!
- (E.g. Several LINEROUTES commencing from a given STOP can depart from the same STOPPOINT, but this S.P. should
  always be separated from the STOPPOINT served by LINEROUTES which pass through that STOP.)

### LINES / LINEROUTES:
- LINEROUTES will be imported into BusMezzo as {lines} assigned with different numbers (IDs)
  - the original LINEROUTE name/no. will be saved under a separate attribute in the BM file.
- Intermediate LINEROUTE segments can use shared LINK segments and STOPPOINTS with other LINEROUTES
  - but: first and last LINEROUTE segment require separate LINKS and origin/destination-only STOPOINTS.

### TIMEPROFILES:
- Only ONE TIMEPROFILE per each LINEROUTE (preferably, name = '1').
- Remember to assign the VEHICLECOMBINATION to each TIMEPROFILE!
- VEHICLE JOURNEYS need to be defined for each TIMEPROFILE / LINEROUTE.
- BM {trips} format 2: TIMEPROFILES imported with exact departure times from the origin {stop}.
- BM {trips} format 3: TIMEPROFILES imported with average service headways (rounded to 30 secs).

### VEHICLEUNITS / VEHICLECOMBINATIONS:
- These should be defined and assigned to the specific TIMEPROFILES.
- Make sure that Seat/TotalCapacity parameters are defined, and SeatCap <= TotalCap.
- BM {vehicle_scheduling}: simplified driving roster assumed for now (single trips only).

### DEMAND MODEL:
- PuT demand model from Visum will be imported into BusMezzo as {passenger_rates} format: 3.
  (Zone-level OD from Visum -> mapped as stop-level OD into BM, with additional fictitious {stops} created.)
- Make sure that demand matrix is assigned to the PuT DEMAND SEGMENT (in the OD DEMANDDATA settings).
- Furthermore, check that StartTime and EndTime are defined in the SEGMENT TIME SERIES (these should be consistent
  with the PuT assignment simulation time!).
  
# Tests
  
 * The reference network is [Central Part of Krak√≥w](https://github.com/a4arek/Visum_to_BusMezzo_interface/blob/master/test/Krakow_test_I_obw/KRK_test1.ver) saved in .ver file (Visum) and editable _.net_ and _.dmd_ files. 
 * The output files are _.dat_ files in folder https://github.com/a4arek/Visum_to_BusMezzo_interface/tree/master/test/Krakow_test_I_obw copied into [ref](https://github.com/a4arek/Visum_to_BusMezzo_interface/tree/master/test/Krakow_test_I_obw/ref) folder.
 * After changes run [test.py](https://github.com/a4arek/Visum_to_BusMezzo_interface/blob/master/test.py) to assert if files are unchanged. 
 
 # Contributing
 
 All contribution welcomed. 
 Improvements shall be done in personal branches, after running tests (test.py) and documenting changes in pull request we will merge it into master.
 Changes may refer both to code itself as well as test networks.
